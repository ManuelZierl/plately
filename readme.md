# Plately

Plately is a simple templating-engie written in pure python to make massive templating as 
easy as possible. This includes operations like iterative and combinaaiton tamplate building tasks

*... Plately is still work in progress ...*

## Getting started
```python
from plately import Parser

template = """
Dear {(customer)},
It is {.January,February,March.} the {.1,2,3.}th
this is the {o1,1o}th e-mail you receive from us
Your Lucky number of tody is: {?1,2,3,4,5,6,7?}
"""

for result in Parser.parse(template, {"customer": "Anna"}):
    print(result)
```
<details>
  <summary>output</summary>
    
    ```
    Dear Anna,
    It is January the 1th
    this is the 1th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 3
    
    
    Dear Anna,
    It is January the 2th
    this is the 2th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 3
    
    
    Dear Anna,
    It is January the 3th
    this is the 3th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 1
    
    
    Dear Anna,
    It is February the 1th
    this is the 4th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 1
    
    
    Dear Anna,
    It is February the 2th
    this is the 5th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 1
    
    
    Dear Anna,
    It is February the 3th
    this is the 6th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 1
    
    
    Dear Anna,
    It is March the 1th
    this is the 7th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 4
    
    
    Dear Anna,
    It is March the 2th
    this is the 8th e-mail you receive from us
    Your Lucky number of tody is: 4
    
    
    Dear Anna,

## Operations Overview
 A list of the availaibe operations, provided with the first to outputs of the given examples. For a more indepth explanation
 read below ...
 
| type              |  short description                                        | example             |  first-output  | second-output| mnemonic
|---                |---                                                        |---                  |---             |---           |---
| identity          | string is alway converted to itself (useful for escaping) | `{ plately }`       | `"plately"`    |`"plately"`   |
| [product](product)| cartesian product is build between all products           | `{.1,2.}_{.1,2.}`   | `"1_1"`        |`"1_2"`       | point is symbol for product
| iteration         | elements are iterated                                     | `{[1,2]}_{[1,2]}`   | `"1_1"`        |`"2_2"`       | list = iterator  
| random            | random element is choosen                                 | `{?a,b,c?}`         | `"c"`          |`"a"`         | what will i take?
| interval_iterator | elements are iterated but repetent for specific interval  | `{-1,2;2-}`         | `"1"`          |`"1"`         |
| variable          | string is defined by variable name                        | `{(var1)}`          |                |              |
| infinite_iterator | iterterats to infitity until all other operators have sto | `{(oo)}`            |  `"1"`         |`"2"`         | oo = âˆž          
## Operations

Be aware that you can also comine all of these operations in your string. If you are then interatin to all
todo: explain max iteration

#### identity
The `identity` always gets interpreted as itself.

```python
from plately import Parser
for templ in Parser.parse("a{ b }c"):
    print(templ)

```
```
abc
```
this is especially useful for escaping charcters so for example
```python
from plately import Parser
print(Parser.parse("{ { }}"))
```
```
{}
```
the blank spaces are mandatory for plately.

#### product
<a name="pookie"></a>
the product build the caresian product between all other products in an template
```python
from plately import Parser
for result in Parser.parse("img_{.1,2.}_{.1,2,3.}.png"):
    print(result)
```
```
img_1_1.png
img_1_2.png
img_1_3.png
img_2_1.png
img_2_2.png
img_2_3.png
````

#### iteration
```python
from plately import Parser
for result in Parser.parse("img_{[a,b,c]}.png"):
    print(result)
```
img_a.png
img_b.png
img_c.png

#### random
```python
from plately import Parser
Parser.parse("img_{?a,b,c?}.png")
```
```
img_a.png
```

#### interval_iteration
```python
from plately import Parser
for result in Parser.parse("img_{-a,b;2-}{[1,2]}.png"):
    print()
```
```
img_a1.png
img_a2.png
img_b1.png
img_b2.png
```

#### variable
```python
from plately import Parser
for result in Parser.parse("__{(var1)}__", {"var1": "hallo welt"}):
    print(result)
```
``` 
__hallo welt__
``` 

#### infinite_iterator
